        2. Stock of lenevo vr

        4.TOP 10 HIGHEST STOCK ITEM IN NEWROAD BRANCH
        SELECT * FROM (SELECT ITEM_EDESC item, (IN_QUANTITY - OUT_QUANTITY) AS "CURRENT STOCK", Location_edesc AS "Location", branch_edesc as "Branch" FROM AI_STOCK_REPORT WHERE UPPER(branch_edesc) LIKE UPPER('%Newroad%') AND DELETED_FLAG = 'N' ORDER BY (IN_QUANTITY - OUT_QUANTITY) DESC) WHERE ROWNUM <= 10;

        5.TOP 10 LOWEST item stock IN NEWROAD BRANCH
        SELECT * FROM (SELECT ITEM_EDESC item, (IN_QUANTITY - OUT_QUANTITY) AS "CURRENT STOCK", Location_edesc AS "Location", branch_edesc as "Branch" FROM AI_STOCK_REPORT WHERE UPPER(branch_edesc) LIKE UPPER('%Newroad%')AND DELETED_FLAG = 'N'  ORDER BY (IN_QUANTITY - OUT_QUANTITY) ASC) WHERE ROWNUM <= 10;

        6.TOP 10 LOWEST item stock 
        SELECT * FROM (SELECT ITEM_EDESC item, (IN_QUANTITY - OUT_QUANTITY) AS "CURRENT STOCK", Location_edesc AS "Location", branch_edesc as "Branch" FROM AI_STOCK_REPORT WHERE DELETED_FLAG = 'N' ORDER BY (IN_QUANTITY - OUT_QUANTITY) ASC) WHERE ROWNUM <= 10;

        7. TOP 10 HIGHEST item stock 
        SELECT * FROM (SELECT ITEM_EDESC item, (IN_QUANTITY - OUT_QUANTITY) AS "CURRENT STOCK", Location_edesc AS "Location", branch_edesc as "Branch" FROM AI_STOCK_REPORT WHERE DELETED_FLAG = 'N' ORDER BY (IN_QUANTITY - OUT_QUANTITY) DESC) WHERE ROWNUM <= 10;

        8. NEGATIVE STOCK REPORT
        SELECT ITEM_EDESC item, (IN_QUANTITY - OUT_QUANTITY) AS "CURRENT STOCK", Location_edesc AS "Location", branch_edesc as "Branch" FROM AI_STOCK_REPORT WHERE (IN_QUANTITY - OUT_QUANTITY) < 0 AND DELETED_FLAG = 'N' ORDER BY (IN_QUANTITY - OUT_QUANTITY) ASC;

        9. Stock of alcatel

        Important instruction to follow:
        1. Only use Data Query Language . Always use 'SELECT' operator while executing. For others, provide 'I don't know'
        2. Take the reference from example provided while responding.
        3. Provide "I don't know" for nonsense words and single letter quesitons.
        4. Please only include the SQL command in the OUTPUT and nothing else.
        5. The query should fit for Oracle 11g. So follow its rules. Don't use FETCH keyword in sql command ,instead use rownum.
